That is Allah, your Lord: so Blessed be Allah, the Lord of the Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists ) . (39:6 )  He created you (all )  from a single person (Adam )  , then made from him his wife {Hawwa , (Eve ) }. and He has sent down for you of cattle eight pairs (of the sheep , two , male and female , of the goats , two , male and female of the oxen , two , male and female and of the camels, two, male and female ) . He creates you in the wombs of your mothers: creation after creation in there veils of darkness. Such is Allah your Lord His is the Kingdom. La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He ) . How then are you turned away ? (7:54 )  Indeed your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, and then He rose over (Istawa )  the Throne (really in manner that suits His Majesty ) . He brings the night as a cover over the day, seeking it rapidly , and (He created )  the sun, the moon, the stars subjected to His Command. Surely, His is the Creation and Commandment. Blessed is Allah, the Lord of the Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists ) ! (10:32 )  Such is Allah, your Lord in truth. So after the truth, what else can there be, save error. How then are you turned away ?;

What did Allah command us to do  ?;(4:58 )  Verily! Allah commands that you should render back the trusts to those to whom they are due, and that when you judge between men, you judge with justice. Verily, how excellent is the teaching with He (Allah )  gives you! Truly, Allah is Ever All-Hearer, All-Seer. (6:151 )  Say (O Muhammad (PBUH ) )   :“Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited you from: be Join not anything in worship with Him, be good and dutiful to your parents, Kill not your children because of poverty – We provide sustenance for you and for them, come not near to Al-Fawahish (shameful sins, illegal sexual intercourse )  whether committed openly or secretly, and kill not anyone whom Allah has forbidden, except for a just cause (according to Islamic law ) . This He has commanded you that you may understand.;

Who shall we invoke in time of disaster  ?;(29:65 )  And when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allah, making their Faith pure for Him Only: but when He brings them safely to land, behold they give a share of their worship to others . (10:12 )  And when harm touches man, he invokes Us, lying on his side, or sitting or standing. But when We have removed his harm from him, he passes on as if he had never invoked Us for a harm that touched him! Thus it is made fair-seeming to the Musrifun that which they used to do.;

For surely, they killed him not (i.e. Isa (Jesus ) , son of Maryam (Mary )  (PBUT ) )   .158:But Allah raised him (Isa (Jesus )  up (with his body and soul )  unto Himself (and he (PBUH )  is in the heavens ) . And Allah is Ever All- Powerful All-Wise;

What is the life of this world ?;(57:20 ) Know that the life of this world is only play and amusement, pomp and mutual boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children. (It is )  as the likeness of vegetation after rain, thereof the growth is pleasing to the tiller, afterwards it dries up and you see it turning yellow, then it becomes straw. But in the Hereafter (there is )  a severe torment (for the disbelievers – evil-doers ) , and (there is )  Forgiveness from Allah and (His )  Good Pleasure (for the believers – good-doers ) . And the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment.;

How could you save yourself from a painful torment ?;(61:10 – 11 )  10:O you who believe! Shall I guide you to a trade that will save you from a painful torment ? 11:That you believe in Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad (PBUH )  _ )   ;
Whosoever puts his trust in Allah , what will happen to him ?;(65:3 )  And He will provide him from (sources )  he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things;
What is the destination of the disbelievers ?;(57:15 )  So this Day no ransom shall be taken from you (hypocrites ) , nor of those who disbelieved (in the Oneness of Allah – Islamic Monotheism ) .Your abode is the Fire.

Therein they shall have Azwajun Mutahharatun (purified mates or wives ) , and We shall admit them to shades wide and ever deepening (Paradise ) .;
How could you be happy ?;(16:97 )  Whoever works righteousness- whether male or female – While he (or she )  is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism )  verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision ) , and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter ) .;

How do the stories of the prophets in Islam compare with those in Christianity and Judaism ?;That depends on which prophet we are talking about.

The story of Abraham and Sarah and the birth of their son Isaac, who is also considered a prophet.  The story of Jacob and his twelve sons, including Joseph, who is also considered a prophet, and. The most oft-mentioned prophet in the Quran, Moses, and the story of his mission in Egypt to rescue his people. Some of the major differences between the biblical account of some of these prophets and the Quran stem from the fact that the Quran holds that all prophets were immune from major sins. The stories of Prophet Jesus are close to the Bible in their descriptions of his virginal birth and miracles but differ sharply in their account of the divinity of Jesus and crucifixion, the Quran states that Jesus was only a man, not divine, and that before the crucifixion Jesus was taken into heaven and replaced by a person who looked like him.;

What do Muslims believe about Jesus  ?;Muslims overwhelmingly revere Jesus and believe that he was born to the Virgin Mary through an act of God, just as Adam is believed to have been created by God without a father or mother. The Quran describes his conception and birth, as well as his many miracles such as healings of the sick. The Quran also emphasizes that Jesus was a great prophet of God, as well as a messenger who received revelation from God, but that he was, like all other prophets, only a human being;
Why does the Quran talk about Jesus more often than Muhammad ?;Most of the Quran depicts itself as a text addressed to Muhammad, it therefore talks less about Muhammad than it does to Muhammad about other subjects, including previous prophets such as Jesus.;
What is the Ka’bah;The Ka’bah is the cube-shaped building covered with a black cloth in Mecca that is believed by Muslims to have been the first house of worship to God. Muslims throughout the world face towards the Ka’bah when they perform each of their daily prayers.;
How will God determine who goes to heaven and hell ?;We believe that only God knows where a person will end up in the afterlife, since only God knows a person’s intentions, deeds, circumstances, and limitations. We also believe that God will judge human beings according to His complete justice on the Day of Judgment based on both their beliefs and actions, taking into account the opportunities and abilities that He gave them. In the Quran, God’s ninety-nine names include “the Judge” and “the Just.”;
If a person is a good person throughout his or her life, but does not believe in God, will he/she go to hell ?;We believe that God rewards whoever behaves righteously in this life and that God knows the innermost secrets of human hearts and will judge everyone with absolute justice.;
God’s love for humanity is a central theme in many religions. Are there similar teachings in Islam ?;We believe that God’s love for humanity is indeed central to our faith. The Quran mentions God’s compassion and mercy 192 times, as opposed to God’s wrath, which is mentioned only 17 times. Two of God’s main attributes are the “Compassionate” and the “Merciful.” Both of these names denote God’s love and care for all creation. These are the two most often mentioned names of God, since all but one of the 114 chapters in the Quran begin with “In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.” The Quran cites 99 different names or attributes of God, many of which also emphasize these characteristics, including “the Loving,” “the Giving,” “the Forgiving,” and “the Kind.”;
If everything is predestined, If God already knows if we are going to heaven or hell, why doesn’t He just put us there  ?;We believe that, unlike angels or animals, humans have the free will to choose to do good or evil in this life and that even though God knows people’s ultimate destination, they themselves do not have that knowledge. Therefore, whatever actions people commit are based on their free will, for which they are held accountable.;
How does Islam view other religions ?;We believe that respect for freedom of religion and conscience is a basic Islamic principle, and we believe that diversity, including religious diversity, is part of God’s divine plan.1 Moreover, we believe that the salvation of all people, Muslims included, lies with God alone.;
Who are “People of the Book” and what does the Quran say about them ?;The Quran refers to the followers of the previous Abrahamic holy books as “People of the Book,” which is generally interpreted to mean Jews and Christians. The Quran references their special status in its mention of the lawfulness of the meat of People of the Book and the allowance for marriage to women from these religious groups. As it does with Muslims, the Quran describes some as pious and righteous adherents to their religions, while pointing out that others fail to follow the commandments that were sent to them. The Quran also takes issue with some of the beliefs of Judaism and Christianity, such as the belief in the Trinity.;
Whom do Muslims consider to be “infidels” and how should they treat them ?;According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the English word “infidel” means “a person who does not believe in religion or who adheres to a religion other than one’s own.”The word infidel is often wrongly conflated with the Arabic word kafir. In the Quran, “kafir” usually refers to a person who not only rejects the beliefs of Islam but also takes a hostile stance toward Muslims and their religion, it is used primarily to refer to the Meccans who attacked and fought against the Muslim community.We strongly believe that people of other faiths should be treated with love and respect, affirming the Islamic principle respect for freedom of religion and conscience.;
Does Islam teach the hatred or subjugation of non-Muslims ?;We believe that hatred or subjugation of people of other faiths violates the Islamic principles of respect for human dignity and for freedom of religion and conscience. We understand the Quran explicitly to forbid the forcible imposition of religion when it states “there is no compulsion in religion” (2:256 )  and describes religious pluralism as part of God’s plan. The existence of old churches, temples, and synagogues throughout the Muslim world in places like Egypt, Turkey, Palestine, Jordan, Syria, India, and Bosnia and the existence of minority religious populations in those areas demonstrates that this command was historically followed by many Muslim societies.;
Do Muslims believe in the Bible and Torah ?;While the majority of Muslims believe in the five holy books or scriptures mentioned in the Quran as original revelations to the prophets (the Scrolls as revealed to Abraham, the Torah as revealed to Moses, the Psalms as revealed to David, the Gospel as revealed to Jesus ) , they do not believe that they have been preserved in the original form or language in which they were first revealed. However, we believe that the Quran contains the same principles included in these previous scriptures.;
What is your proof of the authenticity of the Quran ?;Muslim historians and scholars describe the history of the Quran and the efforts of Muslims since the early days of Islam to preserve the Quran in its original form. During the Prophet Muhammad’s life, scores of people memorized, recited, and wrote down the Quran. Shortly after the death of the Prophet Muhammad, the Quran was compiled and transcribed by experts who carefully verified every verse by matching it against both the written word and memorized verses. The completed transcript was then copied and distributed across the growing Islamic empire. These copies served as the basis for all copies of the Quran written or printed since.While translations of the Quran may vary, all copies of the Quran in Arabic contain nearly identical language. This standardization, coupled with the millions of people who continue to memorize the entire Quran, ensures the text’s authenticity.;
Is it possible that Buddha is among the “unknown prophets” ?;Although Buddha was not mentioned among the 25 prophets named in the Quran, some Muslim scholars suggest that, because of the high moral standards he advocated, Buddha may have been among the “unknown prophets” who, the Quran proclaims, were assigned for every nation. The same may have been true of founders or major figures in other religious traditions.;
Are there any verses in the Quran or prophetic sayings that speak to the issue of women’s rights ?;Yes, there are many verses and sayings that speak to the issue of women’s rights. They include the following:Equal responsibilities and reward: “For the men who acquiesce to the will of God, and the women who acquiesce, the men who believe and the women who believe, the men who are devout and the women who are devout, the men who are truthful and the women who are truthful, the men who are constant and the women who are constant, the men who are humble and the women who are humble, the men who give charity and the women who give charity, the men who fast and the women who fast, the men who are chaste and the women who are chaste, and the men and women who remember God a lot, God has arranged forgiveness for them, and a magnificent reward.” (Quran, 33:35 ) “And their Lord answered them, ‘I am never unmindful of the work of a worker among you, male or female. You are from each other.’” (Quran, 3:195 ) “Whoever does right, male or female, and is a believer, We will revivify with a good life, and We will pay them their due according to the best of what they have done.” (Quran, 16:97 ) Right to earn money: “. . . to men is allotted what they earn and to women what they earn.” (Quran, 4: 32 ) Right to inherit: “For men is a share of what the parents and close relatives leave, and for women is a share of what the parents and close relatives leave, be it little or much - an obligatory share.” (Quran, 4:7 ) Rights of a daughter: “Whosoever has a daughter and does . . . not insult her, and does not favor his son over her, God will make him enter into paradise.” (Hadith/Prophetic saying ) “Whoever has three daughters and treats them kindly, they will be a protection for him against the Fire.” (Hadith/Prophetic saying )  “Parents cannot force daughters into a marriage.” (Hadith/Prophetic saying )  Rights of a wife: “The best of you is the best to his family, and I am the best among you to my family.” (Hadith/Prophetic saying ) Rights of a mother: “Paradise lies under the feet of mothers.” (Hadith/Prophetic saying ) ;
How are women treated in Muslim countries ?;There are 50 Muslim-majority countries in the world. They differ widely on women’s rights, depending on a variety of factors, including political development, social and economic circumstances, and cultural views and practices, even within a single country, there may be considerable differences because of region (urban or rural ) , education, and even family circumstances. Religion may or may not play a significant role in the rights women have.So, for example, in many Muslim-majority countries women are involved at the highest levels of education, employment, and politics, with many female physicians, engineers, lawyers, and other professionals. Muslim women have been heads of state in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Turkey, Kosovo, and Pakistan.In other countries, women’s freedoms are seriously inhibited due to oppressive patriarchal attitudes and practices.;
How do Muslims get married ?;Marriage ceremonies among Muslims, like marriage ceremonies everywhere, vary widely in different locales and cultures. However, the actual Islamic marriage ceremony generally includes the bride and groom, the bride’s father or guardian, an officiator, and two witnesses. The ceremony includes the marriage proposal and acceptance and the presenting of a gift called mahr by the groom to the bride. The wedding celebration after the ceremony varies widely from culture to culture, but generally involves food, special clothing, and some form of celebration. In some societies, there may also be several days of celebration leading up to or after the wedding.;
Is it true that Muslim men can marry more than one woman ?;It depends on the conditions. We believe that monogamy is the ideal in marriage, as reflected in God’s creation of life in pairs of male and female, as mentioned in various Quranic verses. Where polygamy is illegal, then it is illegal for Muslims to marry more than one wife, which is the case in the U.S. and other Western as well as in many Muslim countries. The Quran does, however, allow men to marry more than one wife with the condition that he treat all wives equally, a standard that even the Quran warns is difficult to achieve, clearly implying a preference for monogamy. The Quran declared polygamy permissible 1400 years ago in the context of war, when caring for orphans was a major concern, polygamy in this situation was supposed to assist widowed women with children who otherwise would have been left to fend for themselves in a brutally patriarchal social order. Polygamy was, of course, not peculiar to the Arabian peninsula, it was widespread in many cultures, including that represented by the Hebrew Bible, where the Patriarchs are all depicted as having multiple wives and Israelite kings had harems numbering in the hundreds.;
Can women marry more than one man ?;Since polygamy was only permitted to provide for widowed women and their children, this purpose would not be served by polyandry, i.e. the marriage of a woman to more than one man, hence there was no point in permitting it.;
What is the Islamic view of divorce ?;While divorce is generally allowed in Muslim communities, there is a hadith (prophetic saying )  describing divorce as “the most hated lawful thing,” because it breaks up the family. Muslims generally encourage couples considering divorce to make use of counseling and mediation. However, if these attempts fail, divorce as a last option is allowed and may, in some situations, be the best attainable outcome.;
Can women initiate a divorce ?;While the Quran describes situations where women can initiate divorce, the ease with which she can do so is often informed by interpretations or practices of Islam that vary widely from country to country. In some Muslim-majority countries, a woman can get a divorce relatively easily while in other countries the continuing influence of patriarchy makes this much more difficult.;
Is Islam opposed to modernity ?;This depends on both what is meant by “modernity” and the varied interpretations by Muslims on this subject. If by modernity one means science, the scientific method and technological advances, then we know that scientific exploration and technological innovation flourished in the Islamic cultures of the Middle Ages, commonly known as the Golden Age of Islam. And today, millions of Muslims are involved, often in leading positions, in the fields of science, mathematics, medicine, engineering and other scientific fields;
What is Sharia ?;Sharia comes from an Arabic word meaning “path to the water.” Sharia is often translated as “Islamic law,” which is not wrong, but incomplete. Sharia is divine guidance that is drawn from the Quran and Sunnah (teachings and guidance of Prophet Muhammad )  for the purpose of helping humanity worship and draw close to God and live with love, kindness, and justice towards His Creation. Sharia has five main objectives: to protect life, property, lineage, religion, and intellect. The overarching objective is to establish social justice, fairness, mercy, and security in societies. Sharia rulings or religious commandments are similar to the Ten Commandments. Both claim divine authority, but require human interpretation, are religiously binding, and in that sense are “sacred law.” Only some of them are social and, of these, only a very few intersect with government law.;
What are the sources of Sharia and how is it developed ?;Sharia is derived from the Quran and Sunnah (prophetic tradition )  by qualified scholars who use an interpretative process that includes qiyas (reasoning by analogy ) , ijma (consensus )  as well as relying on precedent. Islamic law is called fiqh in Arabic, which means “deep understanding.” Islamic law is an interpretation of Sharia and, like Halakha (Jewish law ) , is an ongoing effort and process. Sharia addresses both civil and criminal issues, and its principles regulate both personal and moral aspects of life. For the most part, Sharia is overwhelmingly concerned with personal religious observances such as prayer and fasting. Because much of Sharia is interpretative, it has a degree of flexibility that allows it to function in different societies and cultures. Thus, Islam has historically functioned in diverse areas in the world, generally with a demonstrated record of tolerance and pluralism towards different cultures and religions.;
What topics does Sharia address ?;Sharia can be divided into two broad areas: Guidance in religious worship (ibadat ) , which is the central focus of Islam. Guidance in worldly matters (mu’amalat )  such as visiting the sick, taking care of our parents, marriage, inheritance, investments and business affairs, etc;
What types of Muslims follow Sharia ?;Any observant Muslim would consider him or herself to be Sharia-adherent. It is impossible to find a Muslim who practices any Islamic ritual and does not believe himself or herself to be complying with Sharia.;
Who is Allah, and is He the same as God ? ;When talking about God, Muslims automatically think of Allah (swt ) . Allah, in Arabic language, is "God". He is the Almighty, the One Creator who created the universe, mankind and all other forms of life.;
Is it true that Adam was the first messenger of God ( swt ) ? ;Yes, Adam had the responsibility to convey God's message and laws to his descendants. From the beginning, Adam's message to the first generation of mankind was to worship One True God, Allah ;

Why does Satan despise humans and desire their destruction  ?;When God (swt )  created Adam, God wanted to give Adam some sort of respect, value and position among the other creations. God (swt )  commanded the Angels, including Satan from the Jinn, to prostrate to Adam as a sign of respect and not as a sign of worship. All prostrated to Adam but Satan. Satan was a mighty & a distinguished Jinn. God (swt )  asked him what made you not prostrate to Adam and disobeyed my commandment ? Satan replied, I am better than Adam, you created him from Clay and created me from Fire. God (swt )  cursed Satan. Satan vowed to destroy Adam and his descendants forever;
I am still confused, I thought Satan was an Angel like Gabriel and he has no free will but to worship God  ?;"False. If Satan was an Angel, then we wouldn't have any problems with him at all. Angels are a special creation of God (swt ) . God (swt )  created Angels from divine light (Nur ) . Angles don't have free will in doing things but to worship God (swt )  and obey his commandments. Satan, on the other hand, is a Jinn ""spirit"", and like humans, Satan and his race ""jinnkind"" have free will in their actions, free will of doing good and free will of doing bad. Ref. QURAN (18:50 )  ";
Why did God ( swt )    send messengers, and why not instead, communicated with us directly ?;First, that is God's (swt )  will. Second, and because of God's greatness and might, humans, in their earthly bodies, can't withstand God's direct presence. We would die instantly if God (swt )  would to manifest Himself to us. Only from the mercy of God (swt )  prophet Moses (as )  fell unconscious when God (swt )  began manifesting him self near the mount. The mount itself exploded to pieces. God's messengers are nothing but human beings, who ate like us, dressed like us, grew up amongst us, spoke our language in order for mankind to comprehend what they utter. God (swt )  equipped His messengers with miracles to prove the authenticity of their message;
What is Islam, and what does the word ' Islam ' mean ?;"Islam is God's eternal message to mankind. Islam originated by our father Adam (as )  and then the torch was passed on to other God's elect messengers. Islam's message was, still and will be the belief in and submission to ONE God (swt ) , the Creator and the Sustainer of all things, the Exalted and the Redeemer of all things. The word Islam itself means ""submission and surrendering"" to God (swt ) . ";
What is the deal with the term ' Mohammadeen ' , ' Muhammadanism ' or Muhammadans in Islam ?;"There are no such terms at all. Other religions have been named after their founders or after the community in which the religion was prospered. For example, Christianity has been named after Christ. Judaism after the tribe of Judah, and Buddhism after Buddha. Westerners falsely gave the name ""Muhammadanism"" or Mohammadeen"" to Islam after Mohammad (pbuh )  the prophet of Islam, and also called his followers ""Muhammadans"". Islam and Muslims are the words of the QURAN (27:31 ) , (3:19 )  & (22:78 ) . Again, Islam is God's eternal message to mankind that originated by Adam (as )  and sealed by prophet Mohammad (pbuh ) . ";
I heard something about the 5 pillars of Islam and the 5 pillars of faith. Could you elaborate more on these pillars ?;"You are right! Islam has two different types of pillars: The pillars of Islam and the pillars of faith in Islam. The 5 pillars of Islam are: "Al-Shahadatan" the testimony that there is no God but Allah and Mohammad is Messenger of Allah, performing prayer (Salah ) , giving Alms (Zakah ) , fasting (Sawm ) , and performing Pilgrimage (Hajj )  for those who are able.  The 5 pillars of Faith in Islam are: The belief in One God, Allah (swt ) , the belief in His Angels, the belief in His Scriptures, the belief in His Messengers, and the belief in Judgment Day";
Is it really sensible that God will reward Heaven only to Muslims and punish others that can easily add up to millions or even billions of people of various religions ?;Yes it is very sensible. If you read both the Bible and the Quran you will uncover that God (swt )  severely punished the unbelievers and the wicked people through out the history of mankind. That includes the people of Prophet Noah (as ) , the people of Prophet Abraham (as ) , Lot, Moses (as ) , etc... Numbers don't mean a thing in the eyes of God (swt )  and that shouldn't be considered as an exception at all. Only faith counts and not numbers. ;
What does Islam say about Satan ?;Satan (Shaytan in Arabic )  is believed to be a third type of creation, in addition to humans and angels, known as a “jinn.” Humans are said to have been made from clay, angels from light, and jinn from fire. While the Quran teaches that some jinn are good and submit to God, it states that others, such as Iblis or Shaytan (Satan ) , try to tempt people to do evil, as in the belief about Satan in traditional Christian theology;
What do Muslims believe about Mary;Muslims generally believe that she is the Virgin Mother of the Prophet Jesus. An entire chapter in the Quran is named after her. The chapter called Mary (Maryam in Arabic )  and other verses in the Quran emphasize her piety, righteousness, and status as an exemplar for all people, male and female;
What are the different kinds of prayer that Muslims practice;Prayer among Muslims can take many forms. Three very common forms are Salat (ritual prayer ) , Dhikr (remembrance of God, which usually involves the repetition of God’s names ) , and Du’a (supplication, or asking God for a need or desire or for forgiveness ) ;
How long does each prayer ( Salat )    take;Each prayer (Salat )  lasts 5 to10 minutes, depending on the prescribed length of the prayer and the number and length of Quranic verses recited. Other factors may also influence the length of time a Muslim prays, including the number of additional (non-obligatory )  prayers one chooses to perform, and the pace at which one recites the Quran.;

Idul Adha marks the end of the Hajj or the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. After the public prayers, those who can afford, sacrifice a lamb or a goat to signify Prophet Abraham's obedience to God, shown by his readiness to sacrifice his son Ishmael.;
Does Islam oppress women ?;" No. On the contrary, Islam elevated the status of women 1,400 years ago by giving them the right to divorce, the right to have financial independence and support and the right to be identified as dignified women (Hijab )  when in the rest of the world, including Europe, women had no such rights. Women are equal to men in all acts of piety (Quran 33:32 ) . Islam allows women to keep their maiden name after marriage, their earned money and spend it as they wish, and ask men to be their protector as women on the street can be molested. Prophet Muhammad (P )  told Muslim men, ""the best among you is the one who is best to his family."" Not Islam, but some Muslim men, does oppress women today. This is because of their cultural habits or their ignorance about their religion. Female Genital Mutilations has nothing to do with Islam. It is a pre Islamic African Custom, practiced by non-Muslims including coptic Christians as well.";
What is ' Islamic Fundamentalism ' ?;" There is no concept of ""Fundamentalism"" in Islam. The western media has coined this term to brand those Muslims who wish to return to the basic fundamental principles of Islam and mould their lives accordingly. Islam is a religion of moderation and a practicing God fearing Muslim can neither be a fanatic nor an extremist.";
What is the Islamic Year ? ;The Islamic year started from the migration (Hijra )  of Prophet Muhammad (P )  from Mecca to Medina in 622 AD. It is a lunar year of 354 days. The first month is called Muharram. ;
What are the dietary prohibitions in Islam ?; Muslims are told in the Quran not to eat pork or pork products, meat of the animals who died before being slaughtered or the carnivorous animals (as they eat dead animals ) , nor drink blood or intoxicants such as wine or use any illicit drugs.;
What is the dress code for Muslims ?; Islam emphasizes modesty. No person should be perceived as a sex object. There are certain guidelines both for men and women that their dress should neither be too thin nor too tight to reveal body forms. For men, they must at least cover the area from the knee to navel and for women, their dress should cover all areas except the hands and face. The veil is not essential;
Will the good actions of the non-believers be wasted ?;" No. The Quran clearly says that, ""anyone who has an atom's worth of goodness will see it and anyone who has done an atom's worth of evil will also see it"" (Quran 99:7-8 ) . By that it is meant that those who are non- believers but have done good will be rewarded in this world for their good deed. On the other hand, those who do good if they are Muslims, they will be rewarded not only in this world but also in the world hereafter. However, the final Judgment is up to God himself. (Quran 2:62 ) .";
Do Muslims believe in the hereafter ?; God is Just and manifest His justice, He established the system of accountability. Those who do good will be rewarded and those who do wrong will be punished accordingly. Thus, He created Heaven and Hell and there are admission criteria for both. Muslims believe that the present life is a temporary one. It is a test and if we pass the test, we will be given a life of permanent pleasure in the company of good people in Heaven;
What is the purpose of worship in Islam ?;  The purpose of worship in Islam is to be God conscious. Thus the worship, whether it is prayer, fasting, or charity, is a means to achieve God consciousness so that when one becomes conscious of God, in thought and in action, he is in a better position to receive His bounties both in this world and the hereafter;
What are the pillars of Islam ?;There are five major pillars of Islam which are the articles of faith. These pillars are 1 )  the belief (Iman )  in one God and that Muhammad (Peace be upon him )  is His messenger, 2 )  prayer (Salat )  which are prescribed five times a day, 3 )  fasting (Siyam )  which is required in the month of Ramadan, 4 )  charity (Zakat )  which is the poor-due on the wealth of the rich and 5 )  hajj which is the pilgrimage to Mecca once in a lifetime if one can afford it physically and financially. All the pillars should be of equal height and strength in a building in order to give the building its due shape and proportions. It is not possible that one would do hajj without observing fasting or without practicing regular prayers. Now think of a building which has pillars only. It would not be called a building. In order to make it a building, it has to have a roof, it has to have walls, it has to have doors and windows. These things in Islam are the moral codes of Islam such as honesty, truthfulness, steadfastness and many other human moral qualities. Thus in order to be a Muslim, one should not only be practicing the pillars of Islam but should also have the highest possible attribute for being a good human being. Only then the building is completed and looks beautiful.;
Is Islam Intolerant of other religious minorities ?; Islam recognizes the rights of the minority. To ensure their welfare and safety, Muslim rulers initiated a tax (Jazia )  on them. Prophet Muhammad (P )  forbade Muslim armies to destroy churches and synagogues. Caliph Umer did not even allow them to pray inside a church. Jews were welcomed and flourished in Muslim Spain even when they were persecuted in the rest of Europe. They consider that part of their history as the Golden Era. In Muslim countries, Christians live in prosperity, hold government positions and attend their church. Christian missionaries are allowed to establish and operate their schools and hospitals. However, the same religious tolerance is not always available to Muslim minorities as seen in the past during Spanish inquisition and the crusades, or as seen now by the events in Bosnia, Israel and India. Muslims do recognize that sometimes the actions of a ruler do not reflect the teachings of his religion.;
What do Muslims think of Jesus ? ( Peace be upon him ) ;" Muslims think highly of Jesus (Peace be upon him )  and his worthy mother, Mary. The Quran tells us that Jesus was born of a miraculous birth without a father. ""Lo! The likeness of Jesus with Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him of dust, and then He said unto him: Be and he is"" (Quran 3.59 ) . He was given many miracles as a prophet. These include speaking soon after his birth in defense of his mother's piety. God's other gifts to him included healing the blind and the sick, reviving the dead, making a bird out of clay and most importantly, the message he was carrying. These miracles were given to him by God to establish him as a prophet. According to the Quran, he was not crucified but was raised into Heaven. (Quran, Chapter Maryam ) .";
What is the Islamic view on Dating ?; Islam does not approve of intimate mixing of the sexes, and forbids premarital or extramarital sex. Islam encourages marriage as a shield to such temptations and as a means of having mutual love, mercy and peace;
What is the Islamic view on Abortion ?; Islam considers abortion as murder and does not permit it.;
What is the Islamic view on Homosexuality and AIDs ? ;Islam categorically opposes homosexuality and considers it a sin. However, Muslim physicians are advised to care for AIDs patients with compassion just as they would for other patients;
What is the Islamic view on Euthanasia and Suicide ? ;Islam is opposed to both suicide and euthanasia. Muslims do not believe in heroic measures to prolong the misery in a terminally ill patient;
What is the Islamic view on Organ Transplantation ? ;Islam stresses upon saving lives (Quran 5:32 ) , thus, transplantation in general would be considered permissible provided a donor consent is available. The sale of the organ is not allowed;
What is Islam ?; Islam is not a new religion, but the same truth that God revealed through all His prophets to every people. For a fifth of the world's population, Islam is both a religion and a complete way of life. Muslims follow a religion of peace, mercy, and forgiveness, and the majority has nothing to do with the extremely grave events, which have come to be associated with their faith. ;
What does Islam mean ? ; The Arabic word Islam simply means 'submission', and derives from a word meaning 'peace'. In a religious context it means complete submission to the will of God. 'Muhammadanism' is thus a misnomer because it suggests that Muslims worship Muhammad (peace be upon him )  rather than God. 'Allah' is the Arabic name for God, which is used by Arab Muslims and Christians alike;

What do Muslims believe about God ? ;Muslims believe in One, Unique, Incomparable God in the Angels created by Him, in the prophets through whom His revelations were brought to mankind, in God's complete authority over human destiny and in life after death. Muslims believe in a chain of prophets starting with Adam and including Noah, Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Job, Moses, Aaron, David, Solomon, Elias, Jonah, John the Baptist and Jesus, (peace be upon them ) . But God's final message to man, a reconfirmation of the eternal message and a summing-up of all that has gone before was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him )  through Gabriel;

What do Muslims believe about God ( Allah ) ? ;Muslims believe in One, Unique, Incomparable God in the Angels created by Him, in the prophets through whom His revelations were brought to mankind, in God's complete authority over human destiny and in life after death. Muslims believe in a chain of prophets starting with Adam and including Noah, Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Job, Moses, Aaron, David, Solomon, Elias, Jonah, John the Baptist and Jesus, (peace be upon them ) . But God's final message to man, a reconfirmation of the eternal message and a summing-up of all that has gone before was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him )  through Gabriel;
Who is Allah ? ;Allah means God. It is a personal name, which Allah calls Himself in the Quran. That is where it originates. It can also be found in an Aramaic copy of the Bible, and even Christian Arabs say Allah.;
Does Allah look like us ? ;No, Allah is perfect. He is not like any of His creations. He has told us that He has hands, eyes, a face, and feet, but all of these attributes are befitting to His might and glory. A Muslim does not say a single thing about Allah other than what Allah says about Himself. Allah is Perfect and Unique;
What does it mean to believe in Allah ? ;"To believe in Allah means to believe in total perfection, and uniqueness. It means to believe in His prophets because they are His, and He sent them. We cannot pick and choose. A Muslim must believe in all the prophets of Allah. It means to believe in the Angels! We must love them all. We cannot hate an Angel say, for example, Michael to whom rain and the vegetation of the Earth are attributed or Gabriel to whom revelation (bringing down the scriptures to the prophets )  is attributed It means to believe in Allah's predestination of good and bad. It means to believe in the last day: The day of Judgment
";
Do we see Allah ? ;Allah is not like the sun. Anyone can see the sun. But Allah is the most beautiful. Nothing is as beautiful as Allah. Actually looking at Allah is the greatest pleasure of the people in Paradise. This pleasure Allah does not give anyone but the believers;
Can we see Allah ? ;Allah is not like the sun. Anyone can see the sun. But Allah is the most beautiful. Nothing is as beautiful as Allah. Actually looking at Allah is the greatest pleasure of the people in Paradise. This pleasure Allah does not give anyone but the believers;
Does Allah see us ? ;Allah sees us and knows everything about us. He knows us better than we know ourselves. There is not a leaf on a tree that blows away, or stays in its place except that He knows it. There is not a dry spot, nor a wet spot, nor a grain in the depths of the earth except that Allah knows it;
Can Allah see us ? ;Allah sees us and knows everything about us. He knows us better than we know ourselves. There is not a leaf on a tree that blows away, or stays in its place except that He knows it. There is not a dry spot, nor a wet spot, nor a grain in the depths of the earth except that Allah knows it;
Does Allah answer my prayers ?;We know that Allah answers all the prayers of the believers. This can be in 4 ways: Getting what we ask for  Getting something as good or better!  Being spared something bad that would have happened otherwise. Being rewarded on the day of Judgment with a much greater reward than what we were asking for on earth;
What can I ask of Allah ?;Anything, but don't ask Him to do things like make you a prophet because He has already said that there will be no more prophets. You can ask Allah for guidance, meaning you can ask Him to show you the correct religion;
Who is Muhammad ( peace be upon him )  ? ;Muhammad (peace be upon him )  was born in Makkah in the year 571 A.D., at a time when Christianity was not yet fully established in Europe. Since his father died before his birth and his mother shortly afterwards, so he was raised by his uncle from the respected tribe of Quraish. As he grew up, he became known for his truthfulness, generosity and sincerity so much that he was sought after for his ability to arbitrate in disputes. The historians describe him as calm and meditative. Muhammad (peace be upon him )  was of a deeply religious nature, and had long detested the decadence of his society. It became his habit to meditate from time to time in the Cave of Hira near the summit of Jabal al-Nur, the Mountain of Light near Makkah;
How did Muhammad ( peace be upon him )  become a prophet and a messenger of God ? ;At the age of 40, while engaged in a meditative retreat, Muhammad (peace be upon him )  received his first revelation from God through the Angel Gabriel. This revelation, which continued for twenty-three years, is known as the Quran. As soon as he began to recite the words he heard from Gabriel, and to preach the truth that God had revealed to him, he and his small group of followers suffered bitter persecution, which grew so fierce that in the year 622 God gave them the command to emigrate. This event, the Hijrah, 'migration', in which they left Makkah for the city of Madinah some 260 miles to the north, marks the beginning of the Muslim calendar. After several years, the Prophet (peace be upon him )  and his followers were able to return to Makkah, where they forgave their enemies and established Islam definitively. Before the Prophet (peace be upon him )  died at the age of 63, the greater part of Arabia was Muslim, and within a century of his death Islam had spread to Spain in the West and as Far East as China.;
What is the Quran; ? The Quran is a record of the exact words revealed by God through the Angel Gabriel to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him ) . It was memorized by Muhammad (peace be upon him )  and then dictated to his companions, and written down by scribes, who crosschecked it during his lifetime. Not one word of its 114 Surahs, has been changed over the centuries, so that the Quran is in every detail the unique and miraculous text which was revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him )  fourteen centuries ago;
What is the Quran about ?;The Quran, the last revealed Word of God, is the prime source of every Muslim's faith and practice. It deals with all the subjects which concern us as human beings: wisdom, doctrine, worship, and law, but its basic theme is the relationship between God and His creatures. At the same time, it provides guidelines for a just society, proper human conduct and an equitable economic system;
Are there any other sacred sources ?; Yes, the Sunnah, the practice and example of the Prophet (peace be upon him ) , is the second authority for Muslims. A Hadith is a reliably transmitted report of what the Prophet (peace be upon him )  said, did, or approved. Belief in the Sunnah is part of the Islamic faith. Examples of the Prophet's sayings The Prophet (peace be upon him )  said: 'God has no mercy on one who has no mercy for others.' 'None of you truly believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself.' 'Powerful is not he who knocks the other down, indeed powerful is he who controls himself in a fit of anger.' (From the Hadith collections of Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmidhi and Baihaqi. ) ;
Who were the parents of Jesus ( peace be upon him )  ?; Jesus is the son of Virgin Mary and he had no father. Allah created Jesus ;
Can Jesus ( peace be upon him ) , or Muhammad ( peace be upon him )  be worshipped ? ;No, Allah does not accept that a prophet, a person, an angel, a cow, a stone, or anything be worshipped in place of Him or even along with Him. Worship must be to Allah, the Creator of them.;
Is Allah the same as what Christians call 'the father' ?;" Allah is the Creator, who Jesus (peace be upon him )  worshipped. He is the Creator who spoke to Moses and split the sea for Moses and his followers. That is Allah. But Allah tells us: ""Say Allah is one, He is Perfect, He has never begotten, nor was He begot, and there is no one equal to Him.""";
Is there a trinity in Islam ?; No. Allah is one and perfect;
What about someone who has never heard of Islam ? ;"Allah is the most just. It is inconceivable to perceive of anyone acting with more beneficence than Allah. Allah is the most just and in the Quran He said: ""We will not punish without sending someone to warn you"". The ""We"" here is the majestic we used in Arabic. So if a person never heard about Islam, and was never warned clearly, Allah would have a special test for that person that He knows is equal to the chance that person would have had on earth";
When is the Day of Judgment ?; Only Allah knows;
What is it that keeps us from entering Heaven ? ;Worship of anyone other than Allah is the greatest sin. It is called shirk, and this is not forgiven except through repentance. ;
What about non-Muslims do, they go to heaven ?;"Allah only accepts Islam. He says in the Quran: ""Whoever seeks a religion other than Islam it won't be accepted of him, and he will be one of the losers in the hereafter"". I would rather lose anywhere, but not lose in the hereafter. This is because hellfire is eternal. It never ends and we never die when we go there, if we go there";
Do we believe that Allah created the heavens and earth in 6 days ?;Yes, we do;
Did Allah create evil ?;" Yes, Allah created the good and the bad. Whatever bad happens to us is due to our sins. We sin and Allah pardons much of what we do, however, when something bad happens to us it is our fault, and we are to blame. Bad things that happen to a person are a chance for that person to reflect and ask: ""Why is this happening to me ?"" A chance for a person to return from his sin and obey and worship Allah";
Who are my best friends ?; Your best friends are the ones that care where you go after you are dead. This is how the prophets acted. They cared that we go to heaven, even if it meant some hardship on earth;
Who is my worst enemy ?;That would be the devils, whether they are human devils (evil people ) , or Jinn devils (like Iblis ) . The Arabic word for a devil is Shaytan (similar to Satan ) . Satan wants us all to go to hell. He wants us to be bad on earth. Whether we get rich or do lots of wrong things that we appear to enjoy, he does not care that, but he wants to make sure we don't go to heaven;
Do bad things happen to the believers ( good people )  ?; Yes, they do. But they appear bad to the believers because they are things people don't like. Who likes breaking a leg ? However, when a bad thing happens to a believer this believer is patient. He praises Allah in all circumstances. He knows Allah does not decree something unless it is for his own good.;
Why is the family so important to Muslims ? ;The family is the foundation of Islamic society. The peace and security offered by a stable family unit is greatly valued, and seen as essential for the spiritual growth of its members. A harmonious social order is created by the existence of extended families, children are treasured, and rarely leave home until the time they marry;
What about food ?; Although much simpler than the dietary law followed by Jews and the early Christians, the code which Muslims observe forbids the consumption of pig meat or any kind of intoxicating drink. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him )  taught that 'your body has rights over you', and the consumption of wholesome food and the leading of a healthy lifestyle are seen as religious obligations. The Prophet (peace be upon him )  said: 'Ask God for certainty [of faith] and well-being, for after certainty, no one is given any gift better than health!';
What is the Kabah ? ;The Kabah is the place of worship, which God commanded Abraham and Ishmael to build over four thousand years ago. The building was constructed of stone on what many believe was the original site of a sanctuary established by Adam. God commanded Abraham to summon all mankind to visit this place, and when pilgrims go there today they say 'At Thy service, O Lord', in response to Abraham's summons;
Who are amongst the people that must fast in the blessed month of Ramadan and those that are not obliged to fast in this month ?; Those who must fast: All mature and sane Muslims, male and female. Those who are exempted: The sick, the travelers, too old to fast, women in child birth, women with periods, pregnant women whose health is endangered, breast feeding women whose health is endangered;
What facts about the month of Ramadan have been related by Hadith in regards to what takes place related to heaven and hell ?; The gates of heaven are opened and the gates of hell are shut;
What is one of the Sunnahs when a Muslim, for a valid reason cannot keep fast ?; Not to eat in the presence of a fasting person. Repay it by fasting the number of days missed after Ramadan or give kafaarah equal to the amount of one Sadaqa tul Fitr in charity to the poor for each day missed;
What connection does the Holy Quran and the blessed month of Ramadan have that makes the month very important and sacred ?; The Holy Quran was revealed in Ramadan;
It is said that the odor of a fasting Muslim is more fragrant to Allah Subhanahu wa Ta`ala than what ? ;Musk;
Is it a requirement to enter Masjid Haram from the Baab as-Salaam entrance ?;There is no such requirement. You can enter from any of the many gates;
Can I smoke when I'm in Ihram ?; Try to give up this habit for the good of your health and the well-being of your family. Many chain smokers have returned from the Hajj as non-smokers for good. Alhamdulillah;
When I stone the Jamaraat, is it necessary to hit the target ? ;It is acceptable if the stone falls into the circle without hitting the target;
What does Muslim believe about angels ?;Angels are mentioned many times in the Quran and hadith (prophetic sayings ) . Unlike humans, angels are described as not possessing free will but as being by nature assigned to specific duties. Two of the most prominent angels mentioned by name in the Quran are Gabriel (Jibril )  and Michael (Mikhail ) . Gabriel is the angel of revelation and Michael is the angel of compassion;
What does Islam teach ?; Islam’s primary message, as understood by the overwhelming majority of Muslims, is the continuation of the monotheistic, Abrahamic tradition’s belief in one God. The three major dimensions of Islam include beliefs, ritual practices, and the goal and effort to improve one’s character and actions. There are six major beliefs in Islam. There are also five central practices which are referred to as the Five Pillars. The last dimension of Islam focuses on good works and excellence in character in both one’s spiritual relationship with God and one’s everyday actions;
Why did the Prophet Muhammad marry so many women ?;Polygamy was common in 7th-century Arabia, as it has been in many other cultures, especially for a political leader, for instance, the patriarchs in the Hebrew Bible are shown as having multiple wives, and the kings of Israel are described as having harems numbering in some cases into the hundreds. According to Muslim historians, the Prophet Muhammad’s marriages were contracted to assist needy widows and divorcees and to solidify the community of Muslims by forging alliances among the tribes in and around Medina. In light of the time and place, there was nothing unique or unusual about Muhammad marrying several women;
What do Muslims believe about Mary ?;Muslims generally believe that she is the Virgin Mother of the Prophet Jesus. An entire chapter in the Quran is named after her. The chapter called Mary (Maryam in Arabic )  and other verses in the Quran emphasize her piety, righteousness, and status as an exemplar for all people, male and female;
Why is it that Muslims do not celebrate the birth of Jesus at Christmas ?;The celebration of Christmas, although it certainly has theological dimensions for many Christians, is a part of various Christian cultures and not a part of Muslim cultures. Among Muslims, even the celebration of Muhammad’s birthday is a subject of wide debate;
Is the Quran read only in Arabic ?;Since only 20% of all Muslims are Arabs, the Quran has been translated into and is read in many other languages, with multiple English translations. However, because Muslims consider the original Arabic text to be the literal word of God, during ritual prayers, the Quran is recited in its original Arabic language (just as some Catholic churches still perform mass in Latin or synagogues perform part of their prayer in Hebrew ) . In order to fully comprehend the Quran for instruction and spiritual enrichment, non-Arab Muslims also read the translation in their native language;
What are the different kinds of prayer that Muslims practice ?;Prayer among Muslims can take many forms. Three very common forms are Salat (ritual prayer ) , Dhikr (remembrance of God, which usually involves the repetition of God’s names ) , and Du’a (supplication, or asking God for a need or desire or for forgiveness ) .;
How long does each prayer ( Salat )  take ?;Each prayer (Salat )  lasts 5 to10 minutes, depending on the prescribed length of the prayer and the number and length of Quranic verses recited. Other factors may also influence the length of time a Muslim prays, including the number of additional (non-obligatory )  prayers one chooses to perform, and the pace at which one recites the Quran.;
Can anyone become a Muslim ? ;Yes anyone can. There are two declarations, which are necessary:1- To bear witness that no one deserves to be worshiped except Allah.2- To bear witness that Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him )  is the Messenger of Allah. This makes a person Muslim. But it should be said in Arabic. Next a person takes a shower and s/he is a Muslim. Then what ? After a person becomes Muslim s/he is taught about prayers, fasting, alms to the poor, and pilgrimage. These are the pillars of Islam. Then what ? Muslims are brothers and sisters. A Muslim should love for his brother or sister what s/he loves for him/herself. Allah's wealth does not run out and Allah can provide for us all. We pray for each other, and love each other, and love for our brothers and sisters what we love for ourselves;
Are there signs for the day of Judgment?;To name a few: 1- Objects will begin to talk. 2- There will be much killing, the killer won't know why he killed, and the guy that was killed won't know why he was killed. 3- The Antichrist will come. 4- Prophet Jesus son of Mary will return. 5- Gog and Magog will be set free. 6- The sun will rise from the west (after this sign there can be no more repentance ) .;
What is it that keeps us from entering Heaven ? ;Worship of anyone other than Allah is the greatest sin. It is called shirk, and this is not forgiven except through repentance. ;
Do bad things happen to the believers ( good people )  ? ;Yes, they do. But they appear bad to the believers because they are things people don't like. Who likes breaking a leg ? However, when a bad thing happens to a believer this believer is patient. He praises Allah in all circumstances. He knows Allah does not decree something unless it is for his own good. ;
Who is my worst enemy ?;That would be the devils, whether they are human devils (evil people ) , or Jinn devils (like Iblis ) . The Arabic word for a devil is Shaytan (similar to Satan ) . Satan wants us all to go to hell. He wants us to be bad on earth. Whether we get rich or do lots of wrong things that we appear to enjoy, he does not care that, but he wants to make sure we don't go to heaven;
Who are my best friends ? ;Your best friends are the ones that care where you go after you are dead. This is how the prophets acted. They cared that we go to heaven, even if it meant some hardship on earth.;
Who are amongst the people that must fast in the blessed month of Ramadan and those that are not obliged to fast in this month ? ;Those who must fast: All mature and sane Muslims, male and female. Those who are exempted: The sick, the travelers, too old to fast, women in child birth, women with periods, pregnant women whose health is endangered, breast feeding women whose health is endangered;
Is the Quran read only in Arabic ?;Since only 20% of all Muslims are Arabs, the Quran has been translated into and is read in many other languages, with multiple English translations. However, because Muslims consider the original Arabic text to be the literal word of God, during ritual prayers, the Quran is recited in its original Arabic language (just as some Catholic churches still perform mass in Latin or synagogues perform part of their prayer in Hebrew ) . In order to fully comprehend the Quran for instruction and spiritual enrichment, non-Arab Muslims also read the translation in their native language;
What is Jihad ?;The Arabic term jihad literally means “striving.” Jihad is often mistranslated as “holy war.” While the word can refer to military action against an aggressor, this is by no means the only meaning of the term. Traditionally, Muslim sources distinguish between the “greater” and the “lesser” jihad. The “greater jihad” is described by Muslim scholars as an internal struggle to avoid negative actions and cultivate good character. The “lesser jihad” is the external striving for justice, in selfdefense or against oppression. One can do this in one’s heart, with one’s tongue or pen, and, if these are ineffective, by forcibly trying to change an oppressive situation;
Why can’t Muslims eat pork ?;Because the Quran forbids the practice, a dietary restriction also followed by observant Jews;
Why can’t Muslims drink alcoholic beverages;Because the Quran forbids the practice. The Quran states that while alcohol has some benefits, its harm outweighs its benefits. This prohibition is similar to Buddhist teachings;
What is halal ?;Halal is an Arabic word meaning lawful or permitted. The opposite of halal is haram, which means unlawful or prohibited. While the term is used in relation to many aspects of life, when specifically used in relationship to food, halal refers to any food product that is not prohibited. In reference to meat products, halal means that the animal was slaughtered according to Islamic guidelines, which include reciting God’s name over the animal before slaughter and draining all the blood from the animal. This practice is similar to the guidelines set by Jewish law that classify meat prepared in this manner as kosher.;
How does Islam view science ?;There are numerous verses in the Quran that reference scientific phenomena, including discussions of astronomy, geography, biology, and other aspects of nature and the universe. The Quran includes, for instance, a detailed description of the different stages that the embryo goes through in the womb, as well as descriptions of the creation of the earth and of the interaction between fresh and salt water. These repeated Quranic references to nature and injunctions to seek knowledge helped create a fruitful environment for science in Islamic history when during the “Golden Age of Islam” in the Middle Ages, Muslims were in the forefront of such fields as mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, and medicine. Unfortunately, the economic and political decline of the Muslim world in later centuries brought about a decline in scientific and technological endeavor until recent decades. However, today, many American Muslims and Muslims worldwide work in science-based professions such as medicine, dentistry, and various fields of engineering, and many are leaders in their fields.;
Is Allah the same God of the Christians and Jews;"Yes, Allah is God the Creator, the same God of the Christians and Jews [1].  Allah is just the Arabic word for God and does not symbolize a different god.  So, when the Christians and Jews that speak Arabic call on God, they say “Allah”.  There are Muslim leaders who refuse to use the name God, and this certainly can cause an illusion that “Allah” is an entirely different deity.  Their insistence is a mistake, since we are encouraged in the Quran to, ""Call Him GOD, or call Him the Most Gracious, whichever name you use, to Him belongs the best names.";
Do you believe that non-Muslims go to heaven ? ;Yes, God does assure us that there are believers destined for heaven in all different groups.  The words Islam and Muslim are more than just a name.  They are a description of performing total devotion to God alone.  The equivalent English word for Islam is Submission, which is practiced by a Submitter to God alone [1]. There are submitters who are Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, Hindu, or from other backgrounds.  All submitters who are devoted to God alone without setting up any idols are redeemed by God [2].  Thus, God’s scripture, the Quran, tells us that His devoted worshippers, no matter what they call themselves, will go to heaven;
What are the principal differences between Islam and the other two main monotheistic religions, Christianity and Judaism ? ;The monotheistic religions had prophets and messengers who brought the same message, that God’s worshippers need to Submit to Him alone.  This proclamation was heralded by Abraham, Jacob, Moses, the Patriarchs, and all the prophets of God [1].  Because of this, Muslims believe in all the prophets and what were given through them [2].  Some messengers were directed to remove or add to a minor facet from God’s authorized religion [3], but those sanctioned changes did not make for a completely different religion [4].  Instead, it is the added man-made rules that make such stark differences between the monotheistic religions [5].   Surely, if the different religious communities were to apply God’s laws and scripture alone, they would have very little distinguishing differences and instead would have more commonality ;
What does Islam say about suicide bombing, hijackers, and terrorism in general ? ;God tells us in the Quran that we shall not kill ourselves [1], that life is sacred [2], and that we shall not aggress [3].  If an enemy aggresses and fights us, we can defend ourselves but we have no excuse to fight them if they decide to refrain [4].  Also, we must not kill another believer, so before we strike we have to be absolutely sure [5].  All of this put together means that suicide bombing, hijackings, and terrorism are non-Islamic.;
Why don’t the Muslims believe in Jesus ? ;As a matter of fact, Muslims do believe in Jesus.  They regard him as a servant of God who was given valuable teachings with knowledge of how to enter back into God’s kingdom [1].  So, Muslims know that the Gospel was received through Jesus, the Messiah who was supported with the Holy Spirit ;
What are the pillars of Islam, are they specific rituals;The “pillars” of Islam are the main religious practices which were established through Abraham, long before the Quran and Muhammad. These five religious practices are the core practices of Islam and are faithfully performed by devout Submitters to God. These practices are:  1 )  The profession of faith in God, or in Arabic the Shahada.   This declaration is: “There is no god but God”. 2 )  Five Contact Prayers a day, or in Arabic the Salat. A congregational prayer is substituted for the Noon Prayer on Fridays 3 )  The Obligatory Charity or Zakat in Arabic. 4 )  Observation of the month of fasting, or Ramadan in Arabic. 5 )  The Pilgrimage to be completed once in a Submitters lifetime, or in Arabic the Hajj ;
Please give me examples of 'lending God a loan of righteousness ?;This phrase is used several times in the Quran and describes a beautiful mindset that we can adopt in our lives.  Typically it follows an example or description of righteous actions.  These actions include reverencing God, obeying God, observing the contact prayers, spending in the cause of God, and giving to charity [1].  The implication of this phrase is that we may sacrifice our time, money, and possessions in this world by choosing a more righteous behavior that will bring more benefits in the afterlife [2].  Choosing the unspecified rewards that God will provide in the future over the tangible reward or satisfaction that we may gain at a given moment is one way to show the strength of our belief and trust in God;
Iam afraid of not going to heaven. I want to please God but I feel lost and confused.  I was raised Catholic, and I feel that if I pray the way the other religions taught me God will not approve ?;God has allowed people to divide into many religious groups.  The correct path to find within any of these religions is to worship God alone.   The Quran provides us with a scripture that is not tainted by idol worship, but the message of worshiping God alone can also be found in the Bible.  God provides steps to finding our way in this process.  The most important thing is to trust God, and seek God’s guidance. As long as our prayers are directed to God alone, and do not invoke human or other idols alongside of God, we can trust that God will accept our efforts. Trust in God completely, seek God’s guidance, and God will guide and show you the truth.;
Could you please give me your opinion about Zul-Qarnain in the Quran, mentioned in the chapter 18 ( the cave ) . Is it an allegorical story, a past story, or a prophecy for the future ? ;"We do not know the details outside the Quran, but it appears to be both a historical narrative and a prophecy for the future.  The initial verses describe the travels of Zul-Qarnain.   The remaining verses describe Zul-Qarnain sealing away an evil force known as Gog and Magog behind a dam. At the end of these verses, Zul-Qarnain states that ""When the prophecy of my Lord comes to pass, He will cause the dam to crumble.”  God follows in the next verse stating “At that time, we will let them invade with one another…” The release of Gog and Magog is a prophesized event that is said to happen just before the world ends and we all experience the Day of Judgment";
Please explain the following. Humans were discovered to be alive at least 15,000 years ago, all over the world including the America Continents far from Middle East.  Assuming that Adam and the other messengers were centered in the Middle East, how could these other people possibly hear about God and religion ?;The Quran tells us that a messenger was sent to many communities and that we do not know about many of these messengers.  In the Quran, God informs us of a system: the messenger delivers the message, and then some of the people subsequently corrupt the message and change the resulting religion.  The religion of many people that we can observe today may not appear to be monotheism, but it may have started out that way and still retain some of the original elements.  Additionally, God has filled the world with signs for the believers and can guide anyone who seeks guidance regardless of their circumstance;
Does God punish sinners in this life or wait until after death ?;The answer is both.  God tells us in the Quran that sinners can be punished in this life, and after death.  The Quran provides insight into why some people are punished and not others.  For example, punishment can be a reminder for someone to repent.  If someone repents for a sin, then they may be punished in this life but not after death. Another example is when unrepentant sinners are not punished for a long time. God provides them the opportunity to choose to commit more sins and for which they incur more punishments later in this life and after death. We should trust that God always balances the scales of justice, and those that deserve punishment or redemption will receive it in this life or the next;
Once a mosque has been built and used as a place of worship is it possible to remove it and build something else in its place ?;The answer to your question is yes. Not all masjids are built on a foundation of righteousness, although worship does occur within.  In the Quran, God instructs us to no longer pray at these places [1].  If everyone follows this guidance, then eventually the masjid would fall out of use.  Another example is when our homes can serve as temporary places of worship when a community is small.   Obviously the location of worship will change as the community grows, or when a family moves.;
We are prohibited from using intoxicants and alcohol. But, what falls under this category of intoxicants ? Are we allowed drugs that provide chemical balance and are prescribed by a doctor, like drugs for dementia, schizophrenia, and depression;Anything that intoxicates the mind for the purpose of numbing the senses and impairing the mind is prohibited.  However, taking an intoxicant for a medicinal purpose is fine. One example is, a simple cough mixture could have an intoxicant and will be fine for medicinal purposes;
I read that caffeine and chocolate are stimulants and are considered psychoactive drugs.  So, are caffeine and chocolate considered “intoxicants” that are prohibited for Muslims ?;The answer is no, they are not prohibited for Muslims.  Chocolate and caffeine are not considered to be something which “covers the mind,” or impairs the minds ability to function.  God prohibits us from ingesting that which its main purpose is to cover the mind and impairs our ability to function. Anything that is not prohibited by God in the Quran should be considered permissible;
“ khimar ” in Sura 24:31 is anything that covers, and is not requiring a headcover. What do you understand by the word jilbab in Quran, Sura 33:59 where it tells the women to lengthen their dress ? Does it refer to a 'wrapping' garment or can it refer to any kind of garment or covering ?;You are correct, “khimar” in Sura 24:31 is anything that covers, and so the women are to cover their chests with “khimar,” or any clothing they are wearing, and not specifically a headcover.  There is no requirement in this verse for headcovers.  In Sura 33:59, Jilbab refers simply to a dress or clothing. There is no specific clothing required in this verse either.  The point of lengthening the dress is mentioned in this verse as, “So they will be recognized as righteous.”  God’s Mercy allows a lot of leeway for Muslim women to decide how to dress, so long as their style demonstrates righteous behavior;
I am fairly new to Islam.  Is it bad or haram if I am still trying to memorize Nafila  prayers , and when I pray I use a piece of paper to help me with the Salat and the Nafila prayers ? ;All our religious practices including Salat should be dedicated to God  ALONE  [1]. Mentioning any name beside God, including Muhammad, in Salat is tantamount to idolatry [2].  The Obligatory Salat prayers are the only prayers commanded by God, and thus the only formal prayers we should observe, along with our own independent supplications.  There are no rules on how to memorize the Obligatory Salat prayers, so you can learn them the way you find works the best for you.

Sometimes I am so sad and depressed because I am so ugly.  But I want to date and marry handsome Muslim boy.  Can I pray to Allah ?;You can always pray to God (Allah in Arabic ) .  God is in control of all things, including happiness [1].  Praying to God to guide us in our lives is an important step in developing our souls [2].  Studying the Quran will help in seeking God’s guidance [3].  Keep in mind that a soul growing with God’s guidance will outshine and outlast any physical beauty in this world.

I am preparing to observe Hajj this year.  The symbolic stoning of Satan is one of the rituals performed during Hajj, but why is it not mentioned in the Quran ?  Is it a ritual that I should be performing ?;The Quran is fully detailed for religious law [1], while the details of religious duties were passed down to us through Abraham [2]. The Quran corrects corrupted religious duties, such as the tone used during Contact Prayers, but does not detail all of the religious rituals [3].  Thus, when Mohammad was observing Obligatory Salat Prayers, the prayers were those handed down through the generations from Abraham. The ritual you mention was a ritual we follow which came to us since the time of Abraham. It is one of the rituals that believers should perform at the time of Hajj   Relevant Quran Verses:  [1]  6:113-115, 10:37, 31:27,   [2] 16:123, 22:78, Appendix 9 of the Quran translation by R.

In most verses of the Quran, Allah says 'Your wife or wives.”   Why does it not say 'Your spouses ?”  In the Bible, God says 'Your spouses.”   Does Allah intend to speak only to men in the Quran ?  Why do I see very few verses about women ?;Most of the Quran verses in Arabic say “Your spouses”  [1] .  Translators, especially in India and Pakistan, translate as “Your wife or wives,” rather than the more accurate meaning of “Your spouses.”  There are Quran verses that speak of the equality of men and women, so we know God does not have a preference [2].  Thus, it is the bias or inaccuracies of the translator, rather than the Quran, that leaves the impression that God intends to not address the women. Relevant Quran Verses: Relevant Quran Verses:  [1] 2:25, 16:72, 23:6, 30:21,  [2] 33:35, 4:25, 4:57, 13:23;
I am fasting for Ramadan, but when I woke up this morning I felt queasy with a fever.  I think it’s the flu.  I should be allowed to stop fasting while I am sick.  What are the rules for fasting and breaking the fast ?;Fasting is decreed for God’s believers [1], however, God does not wish to make the religion difficult for us [2] .  An individual is authorized to modify their fast if it becomes a hardship.  If one is ill or traveling, an equal number of other days may be substituted. Other modification choices for those who can fast, but with great difficulty,  they may substitute feeding one poor person for each day of breaking the fast.  Additional righteous works are also accepted.  But God does state that fasting is the best for us  [3].  Thus, if you have the flu and it is a hardship on you to fast, you are permitted to modify your Ramadan fast  [4]. Relevant Quran Verses:  [1] 2:183,  [2]  2:185, 5:6,  [3] 2:184-185,  [4] 2:183-187;
I was a Muslim but then I left the faith. I always believed in God, but I didn't have a religion. Now I realize what I have done and I regret it. I started back with the daily Salat Prayers, and I need to know, did God forgive me ?;God accepts all sincere repentance. We encourage you to study a translation of the Quran so that you know what God says in His Scripture  [1].  God guarantees in the Quran that if you reverence God, He will enlighten you, remit your sins, and forgive you [ 2].   He is Most Merciful, the Forgiver and the acceptor of repentance [3]. Relevant Quran Verses:  [1] 26:198, [2] 8:29, 4:31, 39:35, [3] 3:90, 4:17-18, 9:104, 40:3;
Please clarify what this means. 36:68 - ' Whomever we permit to live for a long time, we revert him to weakness.  Do they not understand ? ' What is the purpose of God reverting us to weakness in old;As you might know, we are all here for a test to determine whether or not to accept God’s absolute authority in our lives [1].  In doing so, God allows us the freedom of choice in this matter [2]. Regardless of our choice, our lives tend to have ups and downs [3], and how we view these changes depends on our relationship to God. As we become older, we become, inevitably, physically weaker and lose some of our abilities.  For those who turn to God during this time, it serves as an opportunity to further reduce our egos and appreciate God’s gifts in our lives.  For others, it may only be a source of regret and bitterness. Additionally, many people pride themselves on their physical appearance and abilities, but these are inevitably temporary.  Our impending old age is always a reminder not to set up your physical body as an idol in our life. Relevant Quran Verses:  [1] 7:172-174, 26:89-91, 67:1-2,  [2] 33:72, 76:2-3,  [3] 2:155-157, 6:42-45, 6:165, 89:15-16.;
Is health insurance or any other form of insurance allowed in Islam ? I think it is not because God is in control and is doing everything. I trust God but my friends think otherwise. Please enlighten me on this ?;There is nothing in the Quran that restricts the purchase of insurance. Logically, insurance is unnecessary if you trust that God is in full control of all things [1]. Insurance can play different roles in the society and economic infrastructure of a country.  For example, in many countries health insurance takes the place of a national health care system.  Routine check-ups are paid for through this system.  In other cases, it is required by law in certain situations.  In general, everyone who becomes a submitter goes through various stages (84:19 )  and growth of his/her submission to God.  There is no need to push people into a decision regarding insurance with which they are not comfortable. Relevant Quran Verses:  [1] 4:126, 6:59-61, 6:102, 10:31, 11:56-57;
If someone taught somebody else a wrong path, like a sin that he used to perform and then his friend repeated that sin, what can he do to ask forgiveness from Allah ?  How can he be forgiven for the sins that others may commit based on what he taught them ?;In the Quran, God mentions that those who lead others to sin will pay for their own sin and no one else’s [1].  However, if someone actively helps or leads others into sin, then that person shares responsibility [2].  However, the punishment in the hereafter is reserved for those who do not repent.  The good news is that God forgives all sins for those who sincerely repent well before death approaches them [3].  Sins can even be transformed into credits for those who repent, believe and lead a righteous life [4].  So, this person should pray to God for forgiveness, and live their repentance in their actions, thoughts, and words to show their sincerity.Relevant Quran Verses: [1] 6:160, 10:27, 40:40,  [2] 14:40,  [3] 2:60, 4:17-18, 11:90,  [4]  25:70-71;
I'm reading the Quran for the third time and each time I discover something new.  I noticed that in several suras, intercession is forbidden except for those permitted by God.  What kind of intercession would God permit ?  I'm confused because I thought God did not allow any kind of intercession.  Please explain. God bless ?;"Type of intercession God will permit will be ""those who conform to the laws of the Most Gracious"" and ""and whose utterances conform to His will” [1]. There is no intercession unless it conforms to God's will, which is the same as saying there will be no intercession.  A person who attempts to “intercede” has no actual effect on the situation.  There are many examples of messengers of God who were unable to intercede for those that were close to them [2].  God also states in the Quran, that on the Day of Judgment, “no intercession will be accepted”, and that “all intercession belongs to God” [3]. Relevant Quran Verses: [1] 19:87, 20:109,  [2] 9:113-114, 11:41-47, 66:10,  [3] 2:48, 2:254, 39:44. ";
The symbolic stoning of satan is one of the ritual performed during Haj but is not mentioned in the Quran.  What is your opinion on this in light of the Quran ?;The Quran is fully detailed for religious law [1], while the details of religious duties were given to Abraham [2]. Thus the ritual you mention is a ritual we follow because it came to us since the time of Abraham.  For reasons that only God knows, it was not necessary to mention this ritual specifically and it does not violate any other laws in the Quran. There are many examples where God specifically corrected or clarified rituals and customs.  For example, in the Quran, God forbids the hunting of game during Hajj and mentions that Hajj should take place over 4 consecutive months [3].  God knew that as Islam spreads the number of people performing Hajj will grow immensely and these practices ensure that it is sustainable for a large number of people.Relevant Quran Verse: [1] 5:48, 6:114-115,  [2] 2:127-130, 4:125, 22:78,  [3] 2:196-199;
My friend recommended that this summer, I put the Maghrib Sunset and Isha ’ Night prayers together at the time of Maghrib. The reason he gives is that the time period between the standard Isha  Night prayer and Fajr Dawn prayer is very short and not sufficient for rest. He said he merges them together.  Can I merge my prayers together so I can sleep longer during the summer nights ?;Each of the Contact Prayers must be observed during the specified period of time [1]. Contact Prayers are separate and distinct and cannot be combined or made up if one is missed [2].  The Arabic word Salat means to make contact. Thus, the five daily Contact Prayers (Salat )  constitute a specific ritual of contacting God, our Creator, and providing the daily meals for our soul growth.  The specific practice of Salat was given to prophet Abraham and passed down through the generations, and was already in place at the time of prophet Muhammad [3]. Sometimes modifications to the Salat are allowed, but not merging, and only under extenuating circumstances [4].Relevant Quran Verses:  [1][1] 4:103, 70:34,  [2] 38:30-35,  [3] 14:40, 21:73, 10:87, 19:55, 31:17, 8:35, 16:123,  [4]  4:43, 4:101;
I was asked to be a Juma khatib prayer leader in the local masjid, but they stipulated that I should recite dua out loud after every prayer.  I am the only one who is studying Islamic sciences in my town, so I was requested for this duty and I would like to accept, but I have not heard of this practice before.  Should I recite dua loudly after every prayer ?;When the Imam performs the Friday Prayers, he must follow the specified rituals and protocols of delivery for Friday Congregational Prayers without deviation, since the Imam is responsible for leading the Friday Contact between the congregation and God [1].  The religious practices, including all the Salat Contact Prayers and Juma Prayers, were delivered through prophet Abraham and then passed down through the generations to us [2].  Any corruptions that had crept into our worship practices have been corrected for in the Quran [3].  For example, the tone of all prayers has been corrected in Verse 17:110 to a moderate tone, not too soft and not too loud.  Nothing else should be added or taken away from the Friday Prayers.  Thus, you should not recite dua out loud after every prayer [4]. Relevant Quran Verses: [1] 62:9-10, 70:34,  [2] 2:127-130, 21:73, 22:78, 4:125, 16:123,  [3] 41:3, 45:18-20,  [4] 22:32, 2:128;
I know Islam forbids taking drugs, but what if the doctor prescribes a pain reliever after surgery ? My doctor insists that I will heal better and quicker if I take the pain reliever medication after my surgery. Is it permissible for me to take this medicine ?;In the Quran we are advised to stay away from intoxicants.  The Arabic word “khamr” (intoxicant )  means “to cover or obscure.”  The Quran informs that intoxicants are an abomination of the devil, we must not pray while intoxicated.  Satan uses them to provoke animosity and hatred, and to distract us from remembering God [1].  These occur with the abuse of intoxicants.  Thus, one has to determine the intended use of the intoxicant, will it be of targeted use to help in recovery ?  The Quran discusses good provisions in grapes, but reminds that bad from the intoxicants is not a far reach [2].  The Quran teaches us that God does not want to make the religion a hardship and that our intention counts the most [3].   Thus, it should be alright to take medications which are expected to help us over a short period of time, as long as we do not abuse it as an intoxicant.Relevant Quran Verse: [1] 5:90, 5:91, 4:43,  [2] 16:67, 2:219,  [3] 5:6, 2:225, 16:106;
I have a question about taxation and Islam. I buy and sell cars from home and the government charges taxes ( VAT )  on each transaction. I am wondering if islamically I have to pay this tax to the government ?;There is no basis in the Quran for not paying taxes.  A value added tax (VAT )  or sales tax is paid by a customer when purchasing the item. Thus the seller, ideally, should just pass this part of the transaction on to the government.  The Quran forbids usury (excessively high interest )  [1], and mandates that we conduct fair transactions and not cheat a customer [2].  Since the VAT or sales tax is widely known it seems to be a fair and open transaction.  There are plenty of criticisms that can be lodged against the way the tax is implemented, but its existence does not seem to violate the Quran.Relevant Quran Verses:  [1] 2:275-278, 3:130, 4:161, [2] 2:282-283, 4:29, 11:84-87, 17:35, 26:181-184 ;
How can a muslim cure jealousy in Islam ?;If we are feeling jealousy then that is a sign that we are not fully submitting to God alone. A Muslim that is worshiping God alone and following the commandments in the Quran will not feel jealously. God reminds us in the Quran that all provisions come from him alone [1].  These include food, water, money, children, and even basic happiness.  We must trust that God will provide us what we need [2].  If we feel that we are lacking in this life, we must pray to God [3], and be sure we are observing God’s commandments in the Quran.  Being observant will help us to be appreciative, and keep God as the central pillar in our life. Relevant Quran Verses:  [1] 2:22, 3:14, 14:34, 39:17, 50:9, 92:7, [2] 22:58, 29:58-63, 42:36, 51:58, [3] 4:32, 6:41, 11:90 .;
What type of prayer does Allah ( God )  hate ?;God does not like prayers that are directed toward entities other than God [1]. We should direct our prayers to God and not to others such as prophets, messengers, angels, saints, and spirits.  These entities have no power of their own.  All power and knowledge ultimately rest with God [2]. God also does not like prayers which ask Him to violate His own laws.  For example, we should not pray for forgiveness for idolators, only guidance [3].  Idol worship is an unforgivable offense if maintained until death.Relevant Quran Verses:  [1] 2:165, 4:36, 5:72-76, 6:39-46, 22:31, 39:64-66, [2] 2:106, 2:115, 2:259, 2:284, 4:26, 10:3,  [3] 4:48, 4:116, 60:4;
How can we tell if Judgment Day is coming ?  What are the signs to look for ? ;Specific signs leading up to the Day of Judgment can be found in the Quran [1]. The telltale markers are: The moon will split [2], this happened already in 1969.  The Quran’s 19-based Math code will be revealed [3], this happened in 1969-1974. The Creature made from the earth will appear [4], this happened already. The appearance of God’s Messenger of the Covenant [5], this already happened. The Smoke appears after God’s Messenger of the Covenant [6].  And the last sign mentioned in the Quran is that God and Magog will reappear [7], this is yet to happen.

If intoxicants aren't forbidden, then is there a sin in consuming it ?  The Quran says it's sinful and has benefits. Can one get the benefits without incurring sin ?;Per the Quran verses, it seems clear that intoxicants are prohibited and it would be sinful to consume them [1]. The exception would be medicine. If one is medicated, the individual will have to make a decision as to when to perform Obligatory Salat prayers, keeping in mind that each prayer has a specific time frame [2].

I did not fast during Ramadan.  How can I make this up ? Someone today told me that you would need to fast two months for you to make up one fast  ?;God has specified specific days for fasting [1].  Similarly, God specifies specific times for our contact prayers (salat )  [2].  Usually when you fail to perform salat at the specified time, it is a lost opportunity and cannot be made up. The same would apply to fasting.  The exceptions for fasting occurs if you are ill or traveling [3]. These two situations are listed in the Quran. You are allowed substitute fasting at a later date.  Also, if you intended to fast, but were unable to because of some “great difficulty”, then you are allowed to feed 1 poor person for each day your fast was broken [3].  However, what your friend told you does not originate from the Quran.

What method of moon sighting is acceptable for determining the beginning of the month of Ramadan ?;We are not required to physically be able to see the moon to know it is the beginning of a lunar month. God gave us the scientific knowledge to determine exactly when each lunar month begins and ends. Therefore, we can compute when Ramadan begins in any given year in the future [1]. The Quran is fully detailed and it confirms our ability to use the moon as a calculation device [2].Relevant Quran Verse: [1] 2:189 , 2:183-187 , Ramadan Article on Masjid Tucson.org , [2] 10:5.;
If I want to convert to Islam what are the requirements or rules ? ;There is no set path to become Muslim.  The main requirement is that you worship God alone and do not allow idols to rival God in your life.  There are many things in the Quran that God instructs us to do to help accomplish this, and one of the most important is to read the Quran from cover to cover [1].  Reading does not need to be in the original Arabic [2], it should be in the language that you best understand.  You should also work toward establishing the 5 daily contact prayers in your life [3], giving regularly to charity [3], and observe fasting during Ramadan [4].  All of these practices help to strengthen our souls and raise our awareness of God in our daily lives.

What are the signs of the arrival of Imam Mahadi ? Is there any fixed year given in the Quran about his arrival ?;Imam Mahdi has no basis in the Quran. Imam Mahdi is a fabrication of the religious scholars.  There are statements about other future events in the Quran.  For example, the splitting of the moon has already happened, when Astronauts brought back rocks from the moon [1].  There is also mention of the smoke, however this event has not happened yet happened and there is no date specified in the Quran [2] Relevant Quran Verses:  [1] 54:1,  [2] 44:10-15;
Does God only watch over the faith of Islam ? I mean, we have no right to choose when or where we were born.  Now, I am a Muslim because my parents were also Muslims.  If my parents were Christians, I would be a Christian. Why do we have no say in how we are born ?;God watches over and guides people within all faiths.  Regardless of where we begin, we can become submitters to God, or stray into idol worship [1].  Anyone who believes in God and the last days while leading a righteous life is a submitter to God, regardless of their affiliation with a particular religious group [2].  God offers guidance to anyone who is willing to accept it [3].  Therefore, God provides an opportunity to redeem our souls regardless of the circumstances into which we are born.Relevant Quran Verse: [1] 22:16, 24:35, 39:37,  [2] 2:62, 2:277,  [3]  2:142, 2:213, 24:46, 73:19;
How do we know what words to start with during our Obligatory Salat Prayers ?  Where do I find the complete correct steps for the Prayers in the Quran ? ;"One of the prevalent myths is that Muhammad was the founder of Islam, even though Abraham is reported as the first user of the word ""Islam"" and the one who called us ""Muslims"" [1]. Although our religious law is fully detailed in the Quran [2], our religious practices (Salat prayers, Zakat charity, fasting, and Hajj pilgrimage )  were given to Prophet Abraham and passed on to us (and to Prophet Muhammad )  generation to generation [3]. A proof of divine preservation of the Islamic practices given to Abraham is the ""Universal Acceptance"" of such practices. There is no dispute concerning the number of Rak`ahs in all five daily prayers.  The Quran only corrects corrupted inherited religious practice.  For example, the distorted ablution is restored to its original four steps, and the tone of voice during the contact prayers (Salat )  was distorted -many Muslims pray silently.  This was corrected in the Quran [4]. [5].Relevant Quran Verses:  [1] 22:78, [2] 6:110-115, 10:37, [3] 16:123, [4] 5:6, 17:110,  [5] Appendix 9 and Appendix 15, Quran translation by R. Khalifa, Introduction to Salat Contact Prayers";
goes to heaven and hell  ?  You should not feed people who are trying to find the true way of Islam your false ideas or your own opinion.;We never said nor do we advocate that all Christians or Jews or even Muslims will go to Heaven.  We do point out that there are minimum requirements set forth in God’s Scripture that, if met, will guarantee any person (no matter what they call themselves )  happiness in the hereafter [1].  The Quran tells us that those who believe, those who are Jewish, the Christians, and the converts, anyone who (1 )  believes in GOD, and (2 )  believes in the Last Day, and (3 )  leads a righteous life, will receive their recompense from their Lord. They have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve [2]. [3];
Do you believe that Muhammad ( peace be upon him )  was the last prophet of Allah ?;We believe everything the Quran states. Per verse 33:40 Muhammad was the last prophet of God [1].Relevant Quran Verses:  [1] 33:40 ;
I understand the fact that Islam is a religion of peace, but why are some radicals who commit terrorist acts using Islam to justify their actions ?;The answer is because they are either hypocrites, or they do not know the religion of Islam they claim to represent. Those radicals who claim to worship God, and say they are Muslims or are using Islam when committing terrorist acts, have fallen into idolatry.  They have taken their ego’s or their religious leader’s instructions above God’s instructions [1].  In the Quran, God clearly instructs us to not kill ourselves, that life is sacred, and that we shall not aggress [2].  A Muslim can strike in self-defense, but if an enemy refrains, then the Muslim has no excuse to fight them [3].  There is no allowance for terrorism in God’s instructions in the Quran.

I get mad easily and lose my temper with my mom and start yelling at her.  I don’t mean to, but I lose my temper and disrespect her.  I pray to God for forgiveness.  Will God forgive me for these bad sins ?;God does forgive the sins of His sincere servants. The Quran commands us to respect our parents and not to display annoyance [1].  To achieve forgiveness for our sins, we must not only pray for forgiveness, but repent and strive to avoid the bad behavior in the future [2].  We all make mistakes, but we need to seek God’s guidance in avoiding those mistakes in the future.

What do Muslims think about Paradise and Heaven ?;Muslims believe in Heaven, Hell, and the inevitability of Judgment Day [1].  God tells us in the Quran that anyone who 1: believes in God, 2: believes in the Hereafter, and 3: leads a righteous life, will receive their recompense from their Lord, they have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve. [ 2 ]  This leaves the door open for a lot of folks out there who could potentially make it to heaven.  It is an inclusive membership, and not exclusive to just those who call themselves Muslims.  The descriptions of heaven in the Quran are allegorical because our visualization of what to expect must start with quantifications we are familiar with.  For example, some descriptions speak of gardens with flowing streams, mansions, and delicious drinks [3].Relevant Quran Verses:  [1] 4:87, 39:68-70,  [2] 2:62, 5:69,  [3] 2:25, 9:72,  61:12, 76:17,  [4] Appendix 5, and Appendix 11 of the Quran translation by R.

Do Muslims believe in Purgatory ?;Yes, Muslims believe in Purgatory.  We believe that on Judgment Day, all human that passed through this Earth will be brought to stand judgment and subsequently will be stratified into one of four places.  Initially, there will be 4 places: the High Heaven, the Lower Heaven, the Purgatory, and Hell [2].  God will annex the Purgatory into the Lower Heaven.  Thus, the residents of Purgatory will move out of the limbo of the Purgatory and into the lower part of Heaven [3]. [4].

Do couples remain together in the life hereafter, or what happens ? Do we forget each other ?;God tells us in the Quran that we are allowed to enter paradise with the righteous among our families, including our spouses [1].  Those who are fortunate enough to make it to heaven will be given new spouses in hereafter [2].  God also tells us in the Quran that we will be able to remember people and events from our previous lives [3].  The dwellers of heaven will even be able to speak to the dwellers of hell if they choose [4].

We should always remember that God never burdens a soul with more than it can bear [4]. Relevant Quran Verses: [1] 7:80-81, 27:54, 29:28, [2] 5:90, 6:121, [3] 2:120, 3:73, 6:71, 6:81, [4] 23:62;
Is arranged marriage religious ? ;Arranged marriage is based on culture, not on religion. Some basic requirements that all marriages must meet on a religious basis are, that there must be mutual attraction, a dowry for the woman, and a believer should be sure to marry a believer and not an idol-worshipper [1].Relevant Quran Verses:  [1] 4:24, 2:221,  [2] Marriage articles, at Islam Unraveled.org. ;
If Islam's teachings promote equality and being nonjudgmental, why is there a ' judgment ' day and some people go to heaven and some go to hell ? Does the Islamic religion believe in the possibility of reincarnation ?;There is no support in the Quran for reincarnation.  God has provided us one life to choose to follow his guidance [1].  We have been given absolute freedom of choice in this matter [2].  Those who take advantage of this opportunity will be rewarded with heaven in the next life, and those who do not will go to hell [3]. Submission to God is not based on the materials of this world, but on our righteous actions. Thus we are all equal in our opportunity to live a righteous life.  When we are all resurrected, judgment will be done by God alone based on our record [4].Relevant Quran Verses:  [1] 7:23-25, 30:8, 45:22, 46:3, [2] 33:72, [3] 30:13-16, Sura 56, [4] 22:56;
I would like to know more about zakat ( obligatory charity ) . I recently purchased some items some of which I intend to resell and some to give as a gift.  Do I need to pay zakat on my income and on my recent purchases ?  If so, then when ?;Zakat (obligatory charity )  is paid on income not assets. You should pay zakat whenever you have income, whether it is from a paycheck or profitable sale of property. According to the Quran, zakat should be paid when we receive the income [1]. Paying zakat on assets is an innovation of scholars and has no basis in the Quran.  A specific portion, traditionally 2.5% of one’s income, is paid to people in need according to the following priorities: parents, relatives, orphans, the poor, and traveling alien [2]. Relevant Quran Verses:  [1] 6:141, [2] 2:177. ;
I made a mistake.  I have prayed and made sure that it won’t happen again, but I am still tense.  How can I be sure that Allah will accept my repentance ? ;God accepts the repentance of the sincere [1].  You have repented to God, so it is upon you to make sure of your sincerity.  It is essential to guard against similar mistakes in the future and be sure that God is the highest priority in your life [2]. Remembering God and asking for guidance frequently helps us to avoid sin and avoid situations where we are more likely to stray. Relevant Quran Verses: [1] 3:90, 4:17-18, 5:74, 9:104, 40:3, 42:25, [2]  5:91, 9:11, 17:19, 17:25.;
Is it true that when Muslims are praying, they should never allow themselves to be disturbed even in the event of an emergency ?;There is a distinction between prayer, commemoration, and Contact Prayers.  We can pray to God at any time for any blessing. We must pray to God alone [1].  The Quran dictates upon us, that we should commemorate God as often as possible [2].  Contact Prayers, or Salat, is dictated upon all believers five times a day - dawn, noon, afternoon, sunset and night. The Contact Prayers are mentioned by name in the Quran. How to perform Salat and other religious duties in Islam were taught to the prophet Abraham and brought down to us through the generations [3].  The Quran provides corrections to any corruptions in the practices.  During Contact Prayers, Muslims generally would not allow themselves to be disturbed. However, common sense dictates that a real emergency situation would require a different response.  They can allow themselves to be disturbed if the situation requires it. Relevant Quran Verses: [1] 1:5, 2:186, 39:17, [2]  24:36, 73:8, 76:25,  [3] 16:123, 22:78, 4:103, Contact Prayers at Islam Unraveled.org.;
 how long does a widow have to wait before remarrying;The Quran states four months and 10 days [1] Relevant Quran Verses: [1]  2:234,  [2] 6:114, 7:52, 9:54;
Am I allowed to seek a loan from a commercial bank, even though they charge interest ?;The Quran forbids usury, not interest [1].  Usury is defined as excessive interest andt there is nothing wrong with taking or giving interest according to the Quran.  The Arabic language also makes distinction between interest (Fa'eda )  and usury (Reba ) . In practical terms as long as we are dealing with a state-licensed institution, we should be dealing with interest and not usury. Borrowing money and thus paying interest for loans is an essential component for people, businesses and organizations. Thus paying interest, as long as it is not considered excessive by the standard of the day and community is allowed and perfectly legal from a Quranic point of view. Relevant Quran Verses: [1] 2:275-280, 3:130, 4:161, 30:39.;
Are the contact prayers ( Salat )  ever mentioned in the Bible ?  Did Jesus instruct the Christians to observe Salat ?  Did Jesus do Salat ?;All practices in Islam were delivered to the prophet Abraham [1].   Jesus was a prophet who followed Abraham and in the Quran, God informs us that Jesus did indeed observe the contact prayers [2].  Many verses within the Bible refer to Jesus praying alone and with his companions.  Specifically, the Bible states that Jesus instructed people to recite specific words when they pray and to devote their prayers to God alone [3].  These words are similar to Sura 1 “The Key” [4].Relevant Quran Verses: [1] 2:125-129, 21:72-73, 22:78,  [2]  19:29-34,  [3] Mathew 6: 9-13, [4] 1:1-7;
Is there a way I can observe my contact prayers while standing ?  I have a spinal problem and cannot do much bending ?;God willing, your condition will improve. You can certainly do your contact prayer standing or sitting or lying down [1]. Just repeat the words without the movements.  If you have a problem doing ablution, you can do the dry ablution per the following verse [2].  Fortunately for us, God has provided us flexibility so that we may observe our religion under all situations. Relevant Quran Verses: [1]  2:239, [2]  5:6.;
Are all Muslim’s destined to go to Heaven after they complete their time in Hell ?;Hell is eternal [1]. Thus anyone destined for Hell, whoever they may be, whether they call themselves a Muslim, Christian, Jew, Hindu, Atheist, etc… will be there for an eternity. The same applies for anyone destined for Heaven, no matter what they call themselves [2].  The good news is that the minimum criteria for achieving the eternity of Heaven is belief in God, belief in the Last Day, and leading a righteous life [3]. Relevant Quran Verses: [1]5:37, 19:86, 41:28, 18:102,  [2]  22:17,  [3] 2:62, 5:69. ;
Is it ok for my husband and his family to forbid me from talking to my family because of an argument ?;The answer to your question is no.  The Quran does not allow for the man to dictate his wife’s communications and relationships, except in the case of her dishonoring him in his absence [1].  As a matter of fact, instead of allowing oppression of women, the Quran is more pro-women’s rights.  It sets up protections of women’s rights, such as property, marriage, inheritance and dowry rights in Sura 4, Women [2].  The Quran encourages communication, like in the following example for a more serious situation than an argument.  Sura 4, Verse 35 states that, if a couple fears separation, you shall appoint an arbitrator from his family and an arbitrator from her family, if they decide to reconcile, GOD will help them get together. GOD is Omniscient, Cognizant [3]. Relevant Quran Verses: [1]  4:34, [2]  4:19-20, 4:23, 4:24, 4:7, 4:29,;

Does the Quran read in Arabic only?;Since only 20% of all Muslims are Arabs, the Quran has been translated into and is read in many other languages, with multiple English translations.

What does Jihad mean?;The Arabic term jihad literally means “striving.” Jihad is often mistranslated as “holy war.” While the word can refer to military action against an aggressor, this is by no means the only meaning of the term. Traditionally, Muslim sources distinguish between the “greater” and the “lesser” jihad. The “greater jihad” is described by Muslim scholars as an internal struggle to avoid negative actions and cultivate good character. The “lesser jihad” is the external striving for justice, in selfdefense or against oppression. One can do this in one’s heart, with one’s tongue or pen, and, if these are ineffective, by forcibly trying to change an oppressive situation;

They cite the Quran’s: What are Islam’s view of the environment and the importance of protecting it ? Description of the creation of Adam and Eve as the first human beings as contrary to the idea that human beings evolved from more primitive primates. There are hundreds of verses throughout the Quran that describe the wonders of creation and nature and call upon humankind to reflect on them as signs of God. Humans are described as stewards over this earth (as is the case in Jewish and Christian scripture ) , entrusted with its oversight. There are also numerous Quranic as well as prophetic injunctions to avoid waste, excess, and harm to other forms of creation. A prophetic saying forbids wasting water, even when washing in a river. Living a balanced, moderate lifestyle is an important Islamic principle advocated by most Muslim scholars that applies to all aspects of life, including care of the earth and all of creation;

The Quran mentions God’s compassion and mercy 192 times, as opposed to God’s wrath, which is mentioned only 17 times. Two of God’s main attributes are the “Compassionate” and the “Merciful.” Both of these names denote God’s love and care for all creation. These are the two most often mentioned names of God, since all but one of the 114 chapters in the Quran begin with “In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.” The Quran cites 99 different names or attributes of God, many of which also emphasize these characteristics, including “the Loving,” “the Giving,” “the Forgiving,” and “the Kind.”;

How to compare the prophets stories in  Islam with those in  Christianity and Judaism? ;That depends on which prophet we are talking about. In many cases, the stories of the prophets in the Quran are similar to the stories that are in the Bible. Some examples include:the story of Noah and his ark. The story of Abraham and Sarah and the birth of their son Isaac, who is also considered a prophet.  The story of Jacob and his twelve sons, including Joseph, who is also considered a prophet, and. The most oft-mentioned prophet in the Quran, Moses, and the story of his mission in Egypt to rescue his people. Some of the major differences between the biblical account of some of these prophets and the Quran stem from the fact that the Quran holds that all prophets were immune from major sins. The stories of Prophet Jesus are close to the Bible in their descriptions of his virginal birth and miracles but differ sharply in their account of the divinity of Jesus and crucifixion, the Quran states that Jesus was only a man, not divine, and that before the crucifixion Jesus was taken into heaven and replaced by a person who looked like him.;
